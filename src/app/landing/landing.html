    <p class="lead">Thank you for participating in testing my app. Please add as many goals as you can to your bucket list, since I need to see how similar or varied people's lists are!</p>
    <p class="lead">When adding a goal, you will choose between 3 types of goals: Activity, Accomplishment, and Traveling. Activities are things you do only <strong>one time</strong>, whereas Accomplishments are something you work <strong>multiple times for.</strong> </p>
    <p>For example, "Start a novel" is an activity whereas "Finish a novel" is an Accomplishment.
      <br> "Go Snowboarding" is an activity and "Snowboard down a double-black diamond trail" is an Accomplishment!</p>
