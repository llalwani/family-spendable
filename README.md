# Codename: Shared Bucket

The app uses these technologies:

* AngularJS 1.4.x
* Firebase 2.2.x
* AngularFire 1.1.x
* Bootstrap 3.3.x
* UI Boostrap 0.14.x
* Lodash 3.10.x
* SASS
* Gulp

## Getting started

The easiest way to get the code is to download it as a zip file. If you're familiar with Git and Github, you can also clone the repository.

## Run the application

1. You can use any server you like, but I prefer Python 2's built-in server for its simplicity.
Navigate to the /src folder and enter, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, in your terminal.
3. Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Style and structure

This app follows [John Papa's AngularJS style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide),
which is the style guide recommended by the AngularJS core team.

Todo: Switch out angular router for ui-router

Todo: All css will eventually be migrated to SASS and processed with Gulp. They are currently littered throughout the views

Todo: Remove logic fron mainList controller
